        "question": "What is React?",
        "answer": "React (aka React.js or ReactJS) is an **open-source front-end JavaScript library** that is used for building composable user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps based on components in a declarative approach. \n    \n    React was created by [Jordan Walke](https://github.com/jordwalke), a software engineer working for Facebook. React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012."

        "question": "What is the history behind React evolution?\n    The history of ReactJS started in 2010 with the creation of **XHP**. XHP is a PHP extension which improved the syntax of the language such that XML document fragments become valid PHP expressions and the primary purpose was used to create custom and reusable HTML elements.",
        "answer": "The main principle of this extension was to make front-end code easier to understand and to help avoid cross-site scripting attacks. The project was successful to prevent the malicious content submitted by the scrubbing user.\n\n    But there was a different problem with XHP in which dynamic web applications require many roundtrips to the server, and XHP did not solve this problem. Also, the whole UI was re-rendered for small change in the application. Later, the initial prototype of React is created with the name **FaxJ** by Jordan inspired from XHP. Finally after sometime React has been introduced as a new library into JavaScript world.\n\n    **Note:** JSX comes from the idea of XHP"

        "question": "What are the major features of React?",
        "answer": "The major features of React are:\n\n    - Uses **JSX** syntax, a syntax extension of JS that allows developers to write HTML in their JS code.\n    - It uses **Virtual DOM** instead of Real DOM considering that Real DOM manipulations are expensive.\n    - Supports **server-side rendering** which is useful for Search Engine Optimizations(SEO).\n    - Follows **Unidirectional or one-way** data flow or data binding.\n    - Uses **reusable/composable** UI components to develop the view."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is JSX?",
        "answer": "_JSX_ stands for _JavaScript XML_ and it is an XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript. Basically it just provides the syntactic sugar for the `React.createElement(type, props, ...children)` function, giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax.\n\n    In the example below, the text inside `<h1>` tag is returned as JavaScript function to the render function.\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    export default function App() {\n      return (\n          <h1 className=\"greeting\">{\"Hello, this is a JSX Code!\"}</h1>\n      );\n    }\n    ```\n    If you don't use JSX syntax then the respective JavaScript code should be written as below,\n\n    ```javascript\n    import { createElement } from 'react';\n\n    export default function App() {\n      return createElement(\n        'h1',\n        { className: 'greeting' },\n        'Hello, this is a JSX Code!'\n      );\n    }\n    ```\n\n     <details><summary><b>See Class</b></summary>\n     <p>\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    class App extends React.Component {\n      render() {\n        return (\n            <h1 className=\"greeting\">{\"Hello, this is a JSX Code!\"}</h1>\n        );\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n     </p>\n     </details>\n\n    **Note:** JSX is stricter than HTML"
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between Element and Component?",
        "answer": "An _Element_ is a plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components. _Elements_ can contain other _Elements_ in their props. Creating a React element is cheap. Once an element is created, it cannot be mutated.\n\n    The JavaScript representation(Without JSX) of React Element would be as follows:\n\n    ```javascript\n    const element = React.createElement(\"div\", { id: \"login-btn\" }, \"Login\");\n    ```\n    and this element can be simiplified using JSX\n\n    ```html\n      <div id=\"login-btn\">Login</div>\n    ```\n\n    The above `React.createElement()` function returns an object as below:\n\n    ```javascript\n    {\n      type: 'div',\n      props: {\n        children: 'Login',\n        id: 'login-btn'\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Finally, this element renders to the DOM using `ReactDOM.render()`.\n\n    Whereas a **component** can be declared in several different ways. It can be a class with a `render()` method or it can be defined as a function. In either case, it takes props as an input, and returns a JSX tree as the output:\n\n    ```javascript\n    const Button = ({ handleLogin }) => (\n      <div id={\"login-btn\"} onClick={handleLogin}>\n        Login\n      </div>\n    );\n    ```\n\n    Then JSX gets transpiled to a `React.createElement()` function tree:\n\n    ```javascript\n    const Button = ({ handleLogin }) =>\n      React.createElement(\n        \"div\",\n        { id: \"login-btn\", onClick: handleLogin },\n        \"Login\"\n      );\n    ```"
      },
      {
        "question": "How to create components in React?",
        "answer": "Components are the building blocks of creating User Interfaces(UI) in React. There are two possible ways to create a component.\n\n    1. **Function Components:** This is the simplest way to create a component. Those are pure JavaScript functions that accept props object as the one and only one parameter and return React elements to render the output:\n\n       ```jsx harmony\n       function Greeting({ message }) {\n         return <h1>{`Hello, ${message}`}</h1>;\n       }\n       ```\n\n    2. **Class Components:** You can also use ES6 class to define a component. The above function component can be written as a class component:\n\n       ```jsx harmony\n       class Greeting extends React.Component {\n         render() {\n           return <h1>{`Hello, ${this.props.message}`}</h1>;\n         }\n       }\n       ```"
      },
      {
        "question": "When to use a Class Component over a Function Component?",
        "answer": "After the addition of Hooks(i.e. React 16.8 onwards) it is always recommended to use Function components over Class components  in React. Because you could use state, lifecycle methods and other features that were only available in class component present in function component too. \n    \n    But even there are two reasons to use Class components over Function components.\n\n      1. If you need a React functionality whose Function component equivalent is not present yet, like Error Boundaries. \n      2. In older versions, If the component needs _state or lifecycle methods_ then you need to use class component.\n  \n      So the summary to this question is as follows:\n      \n      **Use Function Components:**\n  \n      - If you don't need state or lifecycle methods, and your component is purely presentational.\n      - For simplicity, readability, and modern code practices, especially with the use of React Hooks for state and side effects.\n    \n      **Use Class Components:**\n      \n      - If you need to manage state or use lifecycle methods.\n      - In scenarios where backward compatibility or integration with older code is necessary.\n\n\n    **Note:** You can also use reusable [react error boundary](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary) third-party component without writing any class. i.e, No need to use class components for Error boundaries.\n\n    The usage of Error boundaries from the above library is quite straight forward.\n    >**_Note when using react-error-boundary:_** ErrorBoundary is a client component. You can only pass props to it that are serializeable or use it in files that have a `\"use client\";` directive.\n\n    ```jsx\n    \"use client\";\n\n    import { ErrorBoundary } from \"react-error-boundary\";\n\n    <ErrorBoundary fallback={<div>Something went wrong</div>}>\n      <ExampleApplication />\n    </ErrorBoundary>\n    ```"
      },
      {
        "question": "What are Pure Components?",
        "answer": "Pure components are the components which render the same output for the same state and props. In function components, you can achieve these pure components through memoized `React.memo()` API wrapping around the component. This API prevents unnecessary re-renders by comparing the previous props and new props using shallow comparison. So it will be helpful for performance optimizations. \n    \n    But at the same time, it won't compare the previous state with the current state because function component itself prevents the unnecessary rendering by default when you set the same state again.\n\n    The syntactic representation of memoized components looks like below,\n\n    ```jsx\n    const MemoizedComponent = memo(SomeComponent, arePropsEqual?);\n    ```\n\n    Below is the example of how child component(i.e., EmployeeProfile) prevents re-renders for the same props passed by parent component(i.e.,EmployeeRegForm).\n\n    ```jsx\n      import { memo, useState } from 'react';\n\n      const EmployeeProfile = memo(function EmployeeProfile({ name, email }) {\n        return (<>\n              <p>Name:{name}</p>\n              <p>Email: {email}</p>\n              </>);\n      });\n      export default function EmployeeRegForm() {\n        const [name, setName] = useState('');\n        const [email, setEmail] = useState('');\n        return (\n          <>\n            <label>\n              Name: <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />\n            </label>\n            <label>\n              Email: <input value={email} onChange={e => setEmail(e.target.value)} />\n            </label>\n            <hr/>\n            <EmployeeProfile name={name}/>\n          </>\n        );\n      }\n    ```\n    In the above code, the email prop has not been passed to child component. So there won't be any re-renders for email prop change.\n\n    In class components, the components extending _`React.PureComponent`_ instead of  _`React.Component`_ become the pure components. When props or state changes, _PureComponent_ will do a shallow comparison on both props and state by invoking `shouldComponentUpdate()` lifecycle method. \n\n    **Note:** `React.memo()` is a higher-order component."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is state in React?",
        "answer": "_State_ of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. The important point is whenever the state object changes, the component re-renders. It is always recommended to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components.\n\n    ![state](images/state.jpg)\n\n    Let's take an example of **User** component with `message` state. Here, **useState** hook has been used to add state to the User component and it returns an array with current state and function to update it.\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    import { useState } from \"react\";\n\n    function User() {\n      const [message, setMessage] = useState(\"Welcome to React world\");\n\n      return (\n        <div>\n          <h1>{message}</h1>\n        </div>\n      );\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Whenever React calls your component or access `useState` hook, it gives you a snapshot of the state for that particular render.\n\n    <details><summary><b>See Class</b></summary>\n    <p>\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    import React from 'react';\n    class User extends React.Component {\n      constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n\n        this.state = {\n          message: \"Welcome to React world\",\n        };\n      }\n\n      render() {\n        return (\n          <div>\n            <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>\n          </div>\n        );\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    </p>\n    </details>\n\n    State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component ,i.e., it is not accessible to any other component till the owner component decides to pass it."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are props in React?",
        "answer": "_Props_ are inputs to components. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to components on creation similar to HTML-tag attributes. Here, the data is passed down from a parent component to a child component.\n\n     The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following component functionality:\n\n      1. Pass custom data to your component.\n      2. Trigger state changes.\n      3. Use via `this.props.reactProp` inside component's `render()` method.\n\n      For example, let us create an element with `reactProp` property:\n\n      ```jsx harmony\n      <Element reactProp={\"1\"} />\n      ```\n\n      This `reactProp` (or whatever you came up with) attribute name then becomes a property attached to React's native props object which originally already exists on all components created using React library.\n\n      ```jsx harmony\n      props.reactProp\n      ```\n\n      For example, the usage of props in function component looks like below:\n\n      ```jsx\n      import React from \"react\";\n      import ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\n\n      const ChildComponent = (props) => {\n        return (\n          <div>\n            <p>{props.name}</p>\n            <p>{props.age}</p>\n            <p>{props.gender}</p>\n          </div>\n        );\n      };\n\n      const ParentComponent = () => {\n        return (\n          <div>\n            <ChildComponent name=\"John\" age=\"30\" gender=\"male\" />\n            <ChildComponent name=\"Mary\" age=\"25\" geneder=\"female\"/>\n          </div>\n        );\n      };\n      ```\n\n   The properties from props object can be accessed directly using destructing feature from ES6 (ECMAScript 2015). It is also possible to fallback to default value when the prop value is not specified. The above child component can be simplified like below.\n\n  ```jsx harmony\n    const ChildComponent = ({name, age, gender=\"male\"}) => {\n        return (\n          <div>\n            <p>{name}</p>\n            <p>{age}</p>\n            <p>{gender}</p>\n          </div>\n        );\n      };\n  ``` \n  **Note:** The default value won't be used if you pass `null` or `0` value. i.e, default value is only used if the prop value is missed or `undefined` value has been passed.\n\n  <details><summary><b>See Class</b></summary>\n     The Props accessed in Class Based Component as below\n\n  ```jsx\n        import React from \"react\";\n        import ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\n\n        class ChildComponent extends React.Component {\n          render() {\n            return (\n              <div>\n                <p>{this.props.name}</p>\n                <p>{this.props.age}</p>\n                <p>{this.props.gender}</p>\n              </div>\n            );\n          }\n        }\n\n        class ParentComponent extends React.Component {\n          render() {\n            return (\n              <div>\n                <ChildComponent name=\"John\" age=\"30\"  gender=\"male\" />\n                <ChildComponent name=\"Mary\" age=\"25\"  gender=\"female\" />\n              </div>\n            );\n          }\n        }\n  ```\n  </details>"
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between state and props?",
        "answer": "In React, both `state` and `props` are plain JavaScript objects and used to manage the data of a component, but they are used in different ways and have different characteristics.\n\n    The `state` entity is managed by the component itself and can be updated using the setter(`setState()` for class components) function. Unlike props, state can be modified by the component and is used to manage the internal state of the component. Moreover, changes in the state trigger a re-render of the component and its children. The components cannot become reusable with the usage of state alone.\n\n    On the otherhand, `props` (short for \"properties\") are passed to a component by its parent component and are `read-only`, meaning that they cannot be modified by the own component itself. Also, props can be used to configure the behavior of a component and to pass data between components. The components become reusable with the usage of props."

      {
        "question": "What is the difference between HTML and React event handling?",
        "answer": "Below are some of the main differences between HTML and React event handling,\n\n    1. In HTML, the event name usually represents in _lowercase_ as a convention:\n\n       ```html\n       <button onclick=\"activateLasers()\"></button>\n       ```\n\n       Whereas in React it follows _camelCase_ convention:\n\n       ```jsx harmony\n       <button onClick={activateLasers}>\n       ```\n\n    2. In HTML, you can return `false` to prevent default behavior:\n\n       ```html\n       <a\n         href=\"#\"\n         onclick='console.log(\"The link was clicked.\"); return false;'\n       />\n       ```\n\n       Whereas in React you must call `preventDefault()` explicitly:\n\n       ```javascript\n       function handleClick(event) {\n         event.preventDefault();\n         console.log(\"The link was clicked.\");\n       }\n       ```\n\n    3. In HTML, you need to invoke the function by appending `()`\n       Whereas in react you should not append `()` with the function name. (refer \"activateLasers\" function in the first point for example)"

        "question": "What are synthetic events in React?",
        "answer": "`SyntheticEvent` is a cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event. Its API is same as the browser's native event, including `stopPropagation()` and `preventDefault()`, except the events work identically across all browsers. The native events can be accessed directly from synthetic events using `nativeEvent` attribute.\n\n    Let's take an example of BookStore title search component with the ability to get all native event properties\n\n    ```js\n    function BookStore() {\n      handleTitleChange(e) {\n        console.log('The new title is:', e.target.value);\n        // 'e' represents synthetic event\n        const nativeEvent = e.nativeEvent;\n        console.log(nativeEvent);\n        e.stopPropogation();\n        e.preventDefault();\n      }\n\n      return <input name=\"title\" onChange={handleTitleChange} />\n    }\n    ```"

        "question": "What are inline conditional expressions?",
        "answer": "You can use either _if statements_ or _ternary expressions_ which are available from JS to conditionally render expressions. Apart from these approaches, you can also embed any expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces and then followed by JS logical operator `&&`.\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    <h1>Hello!</h1>;\n    {\n      messages.length > 0 && !isLogin ? (\n        <h2>You have {messages.length} unread messages.</h2>\n      ) : (\n        <h2>You don't have unread messages.</h2>\n      );\n    }\n    ```"

      {
        "question": "What is \"key\" prop and what is the benefit of using it in arrays of elements?",
        "answer": "A `key` is a special attribute you **should** include when mapping over arrays to render data. _Key_ prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.\n\n    Keys should be unique among its siblings. Most often we use ID from our data as _key_:\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    const todoItems = todos.map((todo) => <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li>);\n    ```\n\n    When you don't have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item _index_ as a _key_ as a last resort:\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) => (\n      <li key={index}>{todo.text}</li>\n    ));\n    ```\n\n    **Note:**\n\n    1. Using _indexes_ for _keys_ is **not recommended** if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state.\n    2. If you extract list item as separate component then apply _keys_ on list component instead of `li` tag.\n    3. There will be a warning message in the console if the `key` prop is not present on list items.\n    4. The key attribute accepts either string or number and internally convert it as string type.\n    5. Don't generate the key on the fly something like `key={Math.random()}`. Because the keys will never match up between re-renders  and DOM created everytime."

Attach the above event handler to form elements change or click events\n\n    For example, the name input field updates the user name using `handleChange` event handler as below,\n\n    ```javascript\n    import React, { useState } from \"react\";\n\n    function UserProfile() {\n      const [username, setUsername] = useState(\"\");\n\n      const handleChange = (e) => {\n        setUsername(e.target.value);\n      };\n\n      return (\n        <form>\n          <label>\n            Name:\n            <input type=\"text\" value={username} onChange={handleChange} />\n          </label>\n        </form>\n      );\n    }\n    ```"

        "question": "What are uncontrolled components?",
        "answer": "The **Uncontrolled Components** are the ones that store their own state internally, and you query the DOM using a ref to find its current value when you need it. This is a bit more like traditional HTML.\n\n    The uncontrolled components will be implemented using the below steps,\n    1. Create a ref using useRef react hook in function component or `React.createRef()` in function component.\n    2. Attach this ref to the form element.\n    3. The form element value can be accessed directly through `ref` in event handlers or `componentDidMount` for class components\n\n    In the below UserProfile component, the `username` input is accessed using ref.\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    import React, { useRef } from \"react\";\n\n    function UserProfile() {\n      const usernameRef = useRef(null);\n\n      const handleSubmit = (event) => {\n        event.preventDefault();\n        console.log(\"The submitted username is: \" + usernameRef.current.value);\n      };\n\n      return (\n        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n          <label>\n            Username:\n            <input type=\"text\" ref={usernameRef} />\n          </label>\n          <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n        </form>\n      );\n    }\n    ```\n    In most cases, it's recommend to use controlled components to implement forms. In a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component. The alternative is uncontrolled components, where form data is handled by the DOM itself.\n\n    <details><summary><b>See Class</b></summary>\n    <p>\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    class UserProfile extends React.Component {\n      constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n        this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);\n        this.input = React.createRef();\n      }\n\n      handleSubmit(event) {\n        alert(\"A name was submitted: \" + this.input.current.value);\n        event.preventDefault();\n      }\n\n      render() {\n        return (\n          <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>\n            <label>\n              {\"Name:\"}\n              <input type=\"text\" ref={this.input} />\n            </label>\n            <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" />\n          </form>\n        );\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n    </p>\n    </details>"

        "answer": "A _higher-order component_ (_HOC_) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. Basically, it's a pattern that is derived from React's compositional nature.\n\n    We call them **pure components** because they can accept any dynamically provided child component but they won't modify or copy any behavior from their input components.\n\n    ```javascript\n    const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);\n    ```\n\n    HOC can be used for many use cases:\n\n    1.

        "question": "What is reconciliation?",
        "answer": "`Reconciliation` is the process through which React updates the Browser DOM and makes React work faster. React use a `diffing algorithm` so that component updates are predictable and faster. React would first calculate the difference between the `real DOM` and the copy of DOM `(Virtual DOM)` when there's an update of components.\n    React stores a copy of Browser DOM which is called `Virtual DOM`. When we make changes or add data, React creates a new Virtual DOM and compares it with the previous one. This comparison is done by `Diffing Algorithm`.\n    Now React compares the Virtual DOM with Real DOM. It finds out the changed nodes and updates only the changed nodes in Real DOM leaving the rest nodes as it is. This process is called _Reconciliation_."

        "answer": "No, currently `React.lazy` function supports default exports only. If you would like to import modules which are named exports, you can create an intermediate module that reexports it as the default. It also ensures that tree shaking keeps working and don’t pull unused components.\n    Let's take a component file which exports multiple named components,\n\n    ```javascript\n    // MoreComponents.js\n    export const SomeComponent = /* ... */;\n    export const UnusedComponent = /* ... */;\n    ```\n\n    and reexport `MoreComponents.js` components in an intermediate file `IntermediateComponent.js`\n\n    ```javascript\n    // IntermediateComponent.js\n    export { SomeComponent as default } from \"./MoreComponents.js\";\n    ```\n\n    Now you can import the module using lazy function as below,\n\n    ```javascript\n    import React, { lazy } from \"react\";\n    const SomeComponent = lazy(() => import(\"./IntermediateComponent.js\"));\n    ```"

        "answer": "The attribute names written in JSX turned into keys of JavaScript objects and the JavaScript names cannot contain dashes or reversed words, it is recommended to use camelCase whereever applicable in JSX code. The attribute `class` is a keyword in JavaScript, and JSX is an extension of JavaScript. That's the principle reason why React uses `className` instead of `class`. Pass a string as the `className` prop.\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    render() {\n      return <span className={'menu navigation-menu'}>{'Menu'}</span>\n    }\n    ```"

        "question": "What are fragments?",
        "answer": "It's a common pattern or practice in React for a component to return multiple elements. _Fragments_ let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.\n    You need to use either **<Fragment>** or a shorter syntax having empty tag (**<></>**).\n\n    Below is the example of how to use fragment inside _Story_ component.\n    ```jsx harmony\n    function Story({title, description, date}) {\n      return (\n          <Fragment>\n            <h2>{title}</h2>\n            <p>{description}</p>\n            <p>{date}</p>\n          </Fragment>\n        );\n    }\n    ```\n\n    It is also possible to render list of fragments inside a loop with the mandatory **key** attribute supplied.\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    function StoryBook() {\n      return stories.map(story =>\n        <Fragment key={ story.id}>\n          <h2>{story.title}</h2>\n          <p>{story.description}</p>\n          <p>{story.date}</p>\n        </Fragment>\n        );\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Usually, you don't need to use **<Fragment>** until unless there is a need of _key_ attribute. The usage of shorter syntax looks like below.\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    function Story({title, description, date}) {\n      return (\n          <>\n            <h2>{title}</h2>\n            <p>{description}</p>\n            <p>{date}</p>\n          </>\n        );\n    }\n    ```"

        "question": "Why fragments are better than container divs?",
        "answer": "Below are the list of reasons to prefer fragments over container DOM elements,\n\n    1. Fragments are a bit faster and use less memory by not creating an extra DOM node. This only has a real benefit on very large and deep trees.\n    2. Some CSS mechanisms like _Flexbox_ and _CSS Grid_ have a special parent-child relationships, and adding divs in the middle makes it hard to keep the desired layout.\n    3. The DOM Inspector is less cluttered."

        "answer": "There are memoize libraries available which can be used on function components.\n\n    For example `moize` library can memoize the component in another component.\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    import moize from \"moize\";\n    import Component from \"./components/Component\"; // this module exports a non-memoized component\n\n    const MemoizedFoo = moize.react(Component);\n\n    const Consumer = () => {\n      <div>\n        {\"I will memoize the following entry:\"}\n        <MemoizedFoo />\n      </div>;\n    };\n    ```\n\n    **Update:** Since React v16.6.0, we have a `React.memo`. It provides a higher order component which memoizes component unless the props change. To use it, simply wrap the component using React.memo before you use it.\n\n    ```js\n    const MemoComponent = React.memo(function MemoComponent(props) {\n      /* render using props */\n    });\n    OR;\n    export default React.memo(MyFunctionComponent);\n    ```"

        "question": "How you implement Server Side Rendering or SSR?",
        "answer": "React is already equipped to handle rendering on Node servers. A special version of the DOM renderer is available, which follows the same pattern as on the client side.\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    import ReactDOMServer from \"react-dom/server\";\n    import App from \"./App\";\n\n    ReactDOMServer.renderToString(<App />);\n    ```\n\n    This method will output the regular HTML as a string, which can be then placed inside a page body as part of the server response. On the client side, React detects the pre-rendered content and seamlessly picks up where it left off."

        "question": "How to enable production mode in React?",
        "answer": "You should use Webpack's `DefinePlugin` method to set `NODE_ENV` to `production`, by which it strip out things like propType validation and extra warnings. Apart from this, if you minify the code, for example, Uglify's dead-code elimination to strip out development only code and comments, it will drastically reduce the size of your bundle."

        "answer": "A _switching component_ is a component that renders one of many components. We need to use object to map prop values to components.\n\n    For example, a switching component to display different pages based on `page` prop:\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    import HomePage from \"./HomePage\";\n    import AboutPage from \"./AboutPage\";\n    import ServicesPage from \"./ServicesPage\";\n    import ContactPage from \"./ContactPage\";\n\n    const PAGES = {\n      home: HomePage,\n      about: AboutPage,\n      services: ServicesPage,\n      contact: ContactPage,\n    };\n\n    const Page = (props) => {\n      const Handler = PAGES[props.page] || ContactPage;\n\n      return <Handler {...props} />;\n    };\n\n    // The keys of the PAGES object can be used in the prop types to catch dev-time errors.\n    Page.propTypes = {\n      page: PropTypes.oneOf(Object.keys(PAGES)).isRequired,\n    };\n    ```"

Mixins **should not be used** and can be replaced with _higher-order components_ or _decorators_.\n\n    One of the most commonly used mixins is `PureRenderMixin`. You might be using it in some components to prevent unnecessary re-renders when the props and state are shallowly equal to the previous props and state:\n\n    ```javascript\n    const PureRenderMixin = require(\"react-addons-pure-render-mixin\");\n\n    const Button = React.createClass({\n      mixins: [PureRenderMixin],\n      // ...\n    });\n    ```\n\n     <!-- TODO: mixins are deprecated -->"

In the old days we had a mouse and respective event listeners to handle them but nowadays we have many devices which don't correlate to having a mouse, like phones with touch surface or pens. We need to remember that these events will only work in browsers that support the _Pointer Events_ specification.\n\n    The following event types are now available in _React DOM_:\n\n    1. `onPointerDown`\n    2. `onPointerMove`\n    3. `onPointerUp`\n    4. `onPointerCancel`\n    5. `onGotPointerCapture`\n    6. `onLostPointerCapture`\n    7. `onPointerEnter`\n    8. `onPointerLeave`\n    9. `onPointerOver`\n    10. `onPointerOut`"

        "question": "Why should component names start with capital letter?",
        "answer": "If you are rendering your component using JSX, the name of that component has to begin with a capital letter otherwise React will throw an error as an unrecognized tag. This convention is because only HTML elements and SVG tags can begin with a lowercase letter.\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    function SomeComponent {\n      // Code goes here\n    }\n    ```\n\n    You can define function component which name starts with lowercase letter, but when it's imported it should have capital letter. Here lowercase is fine:\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    function myComponent {\n      render() {\n        return <div />;\n      }\n    }\n\n    export default myComponent;\n    ```\n\n    While when imported in another file it should start with capital letter:\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    import MyComponent from \"./myComponent\";\n    ```"

        "question": "Are custom DOM attributes supported in React v16?",
        "answer": "Yes. In the past, React used to ignore unknown DOM attributes. If you wrote JSX with an attribute that React doesn't recognize, React would just skip it.\n\n    For example, let's take a look at the below attribute:\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    <div mycustomattribute={\"something\"} />\n    ```\n\n    Would render an empty div to the DOM with React v15:\n\n    ```html\n    <div />\n    ```\n\n    In React v16 any unknown attributes will end up in the DOM:\n\n    ```html\n    <div mycustomattribute=\"something\" />\n    ```\n\n    This is useful for supplying browser-specific non-standard attributes, trying new DOM APIs, and integrating with opinionated third-party libraries."
      },
      {
        "question": "How to loop inside JSX?",
        "answer": "You can simply use `Array.prototype.map` with ES6 _arrow function_ syntax.\n\n    For example, the `items` array of objects is mapped into an array of components:\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    <tbody>\n      {items.map((item) => (\n        <SomeComponent key={item.id} name={item.name} />\n      ))}\n    </tbody>\n    ```\n\n    But you can't iterate using `for` loop:\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    <tbody>\n      for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {\n        <SomeComponent key={items[i].id} name={items[i].name} />\n      }\n    </tbody>\n    ```\n\n    This is because JSX tags are transpiled into _function calls_, and you can't use statements inside expressions. This may change thanks to `do` expressions which are _stage 1 proposal_."

        "question": "How do you access props in attribute quotes?",

The below representation won't work:\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    <img className=\"image\" src=\"images/{this.props.image}\" />\n    ```\n\n    But you can put any JS expression inside curly braces as the entire attribute value. So the below expression works:\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    <img className=\"image\" src={\"images/\" + this.props.image} />\n    ```\n\n    Using _template strings_ will also work:\n\n    ```jsx harmony\n    <img className=\"image\" src={`images/${this.props.image}`} />\n    ```"

By looking at some of the packages, `react-native`, `react-art`, `react-canvas`, and `react-three`, it has become clear that the beauty and essence of React has nothing to do with browsers or the DOM.\n\n    To build more environments that React can render to, React team planned to split the main React package into two: `react` and `react-dom`.

        "question": "How do you programmatically navigate using React Router v4?",
        "answer": "There are three different ways to achieve programmatic routing/navigation within components.\n\n     1. **Using the `withRouter()` higher-order function:**\n\n        The `withRouter()` higher-order function will inject the history object as a prop of the component. This object provides `push()` and `replace()` methods to avoid the usage of context.\n\n        ```jsx harmony\n        import { withRouter } from \"react-router-dom\"; // this also works with 'react-router-native'\n\n        const Button = withRouter(({ history }) => (\n          <button\n            type=\"button\"\n            onClick={() => {\n              history.push(\"/new-location\");\n            }}\n          >\n            {\"Click Me!\"}\n          </button>\n        ));\n        ```\n\n     2. **Using `<Route>` component and render props pattern:**\n\n        The `<Route>` component passes the same props as `withRouter()`, so you will be able to access the history methods through the history prop.\n\n        ```jsx harmony\n        import { Route } from \"react-router-dom\";\n\n        const Button = () => (\n          <Route\n            render={({ history }) => (\n              <button\n                type=\"button\"\n                onClick={() => {\n                  history.push(\"/new-location\");\n                }}\n              >\n                {\"Click Me!\"}\n              </button>\n            )}\n          />\n        );\n        ```\n\n     3. **Using context:**\n\n        This option is not recommended and treated as unstable API.\n\n        ```jsx harmony\n        const Button = (props, context) => (\n          <button\n            type=\"button\"\n            onClick={() => {\n              context.history.push(\"/new-location\");\n            }}\n          >\n            {\"Click Me!\"}\n          </button>\n        );\n\n        Button.contextTypes = {\n          history: React.PropTypes.shape({\n            push: React.PropTypes.func.isRequired,\n          }),\n        };\n        ```"

The single state tree makes it easier to keep track of changes over time and debug or inspect the application.\n     2. **State is read-only:** The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened. This ensures that neither the views nor the network callbacks will ever write directly to the state.\n     3. **Changes are made with pure functions:** To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write reducers. Reducers are just pure functions that take the previous state and an action as parameters, and return the next state."

        "question": "What are the downsides of Redux compared to Flux?",
        "answer": "Instead of saying downsides we can say that there are few compromises of using Redux over Flux. Those are as follows:\n\n     1. **You will need to learn to avoid mutations:** Flux is un-opinionated about mutating data, but Redux doesn't like mutations and many packages complementary to Redux assume you never mutate the state. You can enforce this with dev-only packages like `redux-immutable-state-invariant`, Immutable.js, or instructing your team to write non-mutating code.\n     2. **You're going to have to carefully pick your packages:** While Flux explicitly doesn't try to solve problems such as undo/redo, persistence, or forms, Redux has extension points such as middleware and store enhancers, and it has spawned a rich ecosystem.\n     3. **There is no nice Flow integration yet:** Flux currently lets you do very impressive static type checks which Redux doesn't support yet."

It is usually used as a tool to accomplish asynchronous tasks in JavaScript. Think of it as an alternative to Promises. Redux uses the Reactive paradigm because the Store is reactive. The Store observes actions from a distance, and changes itself. RxJS also uses the Reactive paradigm, but instead of being an architecture, it gives you basic building blocks, Observables, to accomplish this pattern."

        "question": "How to reset state in Redux?",
        "answer": "You need to write a _root reducer_ in your application which delegate handling the action to the reducer generated by `combineReducers()`.\n\n     For example, let us take `rootReducer()` to return the initial state after `USER_LOGOUT` action. As we know, reducers are supposed to return the initial state when they are called with `undefined` as the first argument, no matter the action.\n\n     ```javascript\n     const appReducer = combineReducers({\n       /* your app's top-level reducers */\n     });\n\n     const rootReducer = (state, action) => {\n       if (action.type === \"USER_LOGOUT\") {\n         state = undefined;\n       }\n\n       return appReducer(state, action);\n     };\n     ```\n\n     In case of using `redux-persist`, you may also need to clean your storage. `redux-persist` keeps a copy of your state in a storage engine. First, you need to import the appropriate storage engine and then, to parse the state before setting it to undefined and clean each storage state key.\n\n     ```javascript\n     const appReducer = combineReducers({\n       /* your app's top-level reducers */\n     });\n\n     const rootReducer = (state, action) => {\n       if (action.type === \"USER_LOGOUT\") {\n         Object.keys(state).forEach((key) => {\n           storage.removeItem(`persist:${key}`);\n         });\n\n         state = undefined;\n       }\n\n       return appReducer(state, action);\n     };\n     ```"

      {
        "question": "Why are Redux state functions called reducers?",
        "answer": "Reducers always return the accumulation of the state (based on all previous and current actions). Therefore, they act as a reducer of state. Each time a Redux reducer is called, the state and action are passed as parameters. This state is then reduced (or accumulated) based on the action, and then the next state is returned. You could _reduce_ a collection of actions and an initial state (of the store) on which to perform these actions to get the resulting final state."

      {
        "question": "What is the proper way to access Redux store?",
        "answer": "The best way to access your store in a component is to use the `connect()` function, that creates a new component that wraps around your existing one. This pattern is called _Higher-Order Components_, and is generally the preferred way of extending a component's functionality in React. This allows you to map state and action creators to your component, and have them passed in automatically as your store updates.\n\n     Let's take an example of `<FilterLink>` component using connect:\n\n     ```javascript\n     import { connect } from \"react-redux\";\n     import { setVisibilityFilter } from \"../actions\";\n     import Link from \"../components/Link\";\n\n     const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({\n       active: ownProps.filter === state.visibilityFilter,\n     });\n\n     const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) => ({\n       onClick: () => dispatch(setVisibilityFilter(ownProps.filter)),\n     });\n\n     const FilterLink = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Link);\n\n     export default FilterLink;\n     ```\n\n     Due to it having quite a few performance optimizations and generally being less likely to cause bugs, the Redux developers almost always recommend using `connect()` over accessing the store directly (using context API).\n\n     ```javascript\n     function MyComponent {\n       someMethod() {\n         doSomethingWith(this.context.store);\n       }\n     }\n     ```"

Some users prefer to keep every single piece of data in Redux, to maintain a fully serializable and controlled version of their application at all times. Others prefer to keep non-critical or UI state, such as “is this dropdown currently open”, inside a component's internal state.\n\n     Below are the thumb rules to determine what kind of data should be put into Redux\n\n     1. Do other parts of the application care about this data?\n     2. Do you need to be able to create further derived data based on this original data?\n     3. Is the same data being used to drive multiple components?\n     4. Is there value to you in being able to restore this state to a given point in time (ie, time travel debugging)?\n     5.

It's all about adding offline capabilities to your site.\n\n     ```jsx\n     import React from \"react\";\n     import ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\n     import App from \"./App\";\n     import registerServiceWorker from \"./registerServiceWorker\";\n\n     ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById(\"root\"));\n     registerServiceWorker();\n     ```"

        "answer": "You need to follow two rules in order to use hooks,\n\n     1. **Call Hooks only at the top level of your react functions:** You should always use hooks at the top level of react function before any early returns. i.e, You shouldn’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. This will ensure that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders and it preserves the state of Hooks between multiple re-renders due to useState and useEffect calls.\n     2. **Call Hooks from React Functions only:** You shouldn’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions or class components. Instead, you should call them from either function components or custom hooks."

However, prior to React 18, it was recommended to use Loadable Components for code-splitting in a server-side rendered app because React.lazy and Suspense were not available for server-side rendering. Loadable Components lets you render a dynamic import as a regular component. For example, you can use Loadable Components to load the OtherComponent in a separate bundle like this:\n\n     ```javascript\n     import loadable from \"@loadable/component\";\n\n     const OtherComponent = loadable(() => import(\"./OtherComponent\"));\n\n     function MyComponent() {\n       return (\n         <div>\n           <OtherComponent />\n         </div>\n       );\n     }\n     ```\n\n     Now OtherComponent will be loaded in a separated bundle\n     Loadable Components provides additional benefits beyond just code-splitting, such as automatic code reloading, error handling, and preloading.

The diffing algorithms is generating the minimum number of operations to transform one tree into another. However, the algorithms have a complexity in the order of O(n³) where n is the number of elements in the tree.\n\n     In this case, displaying 1000 elements would require in the order of one billion comparisons. This is far too expensive. Instead, React implements a heuristic O(n) algorithm based on two assumptions:\n\n     1. Two elements of different types will produce different trees.\n     2. The developer can hint at which child elements may be stable across different renders with a key prop."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the rules covered by diffing algorithm?",
        "answer": "When diffing two trees, React first compares the two root elements. The behavior is different depending on the types of the root elements. It covers the below rules during reconciliation algorithm,\n\n     1. **Elements Of Different Types:**\n        Whenever the root elements have different types, React will tear down the old tree and build the new tree from scratch. For example, elements <a> to <img>, or from <Article> to <Comment> of different types lead a full rebuild.\n     2. **DOM Elements Of The Same Type:**\n        When comparing two React DOM elements of the same type, React looks at the attributes of both, keeps the same underlying DOM node, and only updates the changed attributes. Lets take an example with same DOM elements except className attribute,\n\n        ```javascript\n        <div className=\"show\" title=\"ReactJS\" />\n\n        <div className=\"hide\" title=\"ReactJS\" />\n        ```\n\n     3. **Component Elements Of The Same Type:**\n        When a component updates, the instance stays the same, so that state is maintained across renders. React updates the props of the underlying component instance to match the new element, and calls componentWillReceiveProps() and componentWillUpdate() on the underlying instance. After that, the render() method is called and the diff algorithm recurses on the previous result and the new result.\n     4. **Recursing On Children:**\n        when recursing on the children of a DOM node, React just iterates over both lists of children at the same time and generates a mutation whenever there’s a difference. For example, when adding an element at the end of the children, converting between these two trees works well.\n\n        ```javascript\n        <ul>\n          <li>first</li>\n          <li>second</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <ul>\n          <li>first</li>\n          <li>second</li>\n          <li>third</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        ```\n\n     5. **Handling keys:**\n        React supports a key attribute. When children have keys, React uses the key to match children in the original tree with children in the subsequent tree. For example, adding a key can make the tree conversion efficient,\n\n     ```javascript\n     <ul>\n       <li key=\"2015\">Duke</li>\n       <li key=\"2016\">Villanova</li>\n     </ul>\n\n     <ul>\n       <li key=\"2014\">Connecticut</li>\n       <li key=\"2015\">Duke</li>\n       <li key=\"2016\">Villanova</li>\n     </ul>\n     ```"

Lets take an example with the children prop for render props,\n\n     ```javascript\n     <Mouse\n       children={(mouse) => (\n         <p>\n           The mouse position is {mouse.x}, {mouse.y}\n         </p>\n       )}\n     />\n     ```\n\n     Actually children prop doesn’t need to be named in the list of “attributes” in JSX element. Instead, you can keep it directly inside element,\n\n     ```javascript\n     <Mouse>\n       {(mouse) => (\n         <p>\n           The mouse position is {mouse.x}, {mouse.y}\n         </p>\n       )}\n     </Mouse>\n     ```\n\n     While using this above technique(without any name), explicitly state that children should be a function in your propTypes.\n\n     ```javascript\n     Mouse.propTypes = {\n       children: PropTypes.func.isRequired,\n     };\n     ```"

To handle this case, you can specify a **defaultValue** attribute instead of **value**.\n\n     ```javascript\n     render() {\n       return (\n         <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>\n           <label>\n             User Name:\n             <input\n               defaultValue=\"John\"\n               type=\"text\"\n               ref={this.input} />\n           </label>\n           <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" />\n         </form>\n       );\n     }\n     ```\n\n     The same applies for `select` and `textArea` inputs.

The first item is the current value, and the second is a function that updates the value. Using [0] and [1] to access them is a bit confusing because they have a specific meaning. This is why we use array destructuring instead.\n\n     For example, the array index access would look as follows:\n\n     ```javascript\n     var userStateVariable = useState(\"userProfile\"); // Returns an array pair\n     var user = userStateVariable[0]; // Access first item\n     var setUser = userStateVariable[1]; // Access second item\n     ```\n\n     Whereas with array destructuring the variables can be accessed as follows:\n\n     ```javascript\n     const [user, setUser] = useState(\"userProfile\");\n     ```"

It allows React to interrupt a long-running render to handle a high-priority event. i.e, When you enabled concurrent Mode, React will keep an eye on other tasks that need to be done, and if there's something with a higher priority it will pause what it is currently rendering and let the other task finish first. You can enable this in two ways,\n\n     ```javascript\n     // 1.

        "answer": "useEffect and useLayoutEffect are both React hooks that can be used to synchronize a component with an external system, such as a browser API or a third-party library. However, there are some key differences between the two:\n\n     - Timing: useEffect runs after the browser has finished painting, while useLayoutEffect runs synchronously before the browser paints. This means that useLayoutEffect can be used to measure and update layout in a way that feels more synchronous to the user.\n\n     - Browser Paint: useEffect allows browser to paint the changes before running the effect, hence it may cause some visual flicker. useLayoutEffect synchronously runs the effect before browser paints and hence it will avoid visual flicker.\n\n     - Execution Order: The order in which multiple useEffect hooks are executed is determined by React and may not be predictable. However, the order in which multiple useLayoutEffect hooks are executed is determined by the order in which they were called.\n\n     - Error handling: useEffect has a built-in mechanism for handling errors that occur during the execution of the effect, so that it does not crash the entire application. useLayoutEffect does not have this mechanism, and errors that occur during the execution of the effect will crash the entire application.\n\n     In general, it's recommended to use useEffect as much as possible, because it is more performant and less prone to errors. useLayoutEffect should only be used when you need to measure or update layout, and you can't achieve the same result using useEffect."

        "question": "What are the differences between Functional and Class Components?",
        "answer": "There are two different ways to create components in ReactJS. The main differences are listed down as below,\n\n      ## 1.  Syntax:\n\n      The classs components uses ES6 classes to create the components. It uses `render` function to display the HTML content in the webpage.\n      \n      The syntax for class component looks like as below.\n        ```js\n        class App extends Reacts.Component {\n          render(){\n            return <h1>This is a class component</h1>}\n          }\n\n        ```\n\n      **Note:** The **Pascal Case** is the recommended approach to provide naming to a component.\n\n      Functional component has been improved over the years with some added features like Hooks. Here is a syntax for functional component.\n\n      ```js\n      function App(){\n        return <div className=\"App\">\n          <h1>Hello, I'm a function component</h1>\n          </div>\n      }\n\n      ```\n\n      ## 2. State:\n\n      State contains information or data about a component which may change over time. \n      \n      In class component, you can update the state when a user interacts with it or server updates the data using the `setState()` method. The initial state is going to be assigned in the `Constructor( ) `method using the the ` this.state` object and it is possible to different data types in the `this.state` object such as string, boolean, numbers, etc.\n      **A simple example showing how we use the setState() and constructor()**\n\n      ```js\n      class App extends Component {\n        constructor() {\n          super();\n          this.state = {\n            message: \"This is a class component\",\n          };\n        }\n        updateMessage() {\n          this.setState({t\n            message: \"Updating the class component\",\n          });\n        }\n        render() {\n          return (\n            <>\n              <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>\n              <button\n                onClick={() => {\n                  this.updateMessage();\n                }}>\n                Click!!\n              </button>\n            </>\n          );\n        }\n      }\n\n      ```\n\n      You not use state in functional components because it was only supported in class components. But over the years hooks have been implemented in functional component which enable to use state in functional component too.\n      \n      The `useState()` hook can used to implement state in funcitonal component. It returns an array with two items: the first item is current state and the next one is a function (setState) that updates the value of the current state. \n      \n      Let's see an example to demonstrate the state in functional components,\n\n      ```js\n      function App() {\n        const [message, setMessage] = useState(\"This is a functional component\");\n        const updateMessage = () => {\n          setMessage(\"Updating the functional component\");\n        };\n        return (\n          <div className=\"App\">\n            <h1>{message} </h1>\n            <button onClick={updateMessage}>Click me!!</button>\n          </div>\n        );\n      }\n      ```\n\n      ## 3. Props:\n      Props are referred to as \"properties\". The props are passed into react component just like arguments passed to a function. In otherwords, they are similar to HTML attributes. \n\n      The props are accessible in child class component using `this.props` as shown in below example,\n      ```js\n      class Child extends React.Component {\n        render() {\n          return <h1> This is a functional component and component name is {this.props.name} </h1>;\n        }\n      }\n\n      class Parent extends React.Component {\n        render() {\n               return (\n                  <div className=\"Parent\">\n                  <Child name=\"First child component\" />\n                  <Child name=\"Second child component\" />\n                  </div>\n                );\n         }\n      }\n      ```\n\n      Props in functional components are similar to that of the class components but the difference is the absence of 'this' keyword. \n\n      ```js\n      function Child(props) {\n        return <h1>This is a child component and the component name is{props.name}</h1>;\n      }\n\n      function Parent() {\n        return (\n          <div className=\"Parent\">\n                <Child name=\"First child component\" />\n                <Child name=\"Second child component\" />\n          </div>\n        );\n      }\n      ```"

        "question": "What is strict mode in React?",
        "answer": "`React.StrictMode` is a useful component for highlighting potential problems in an application. Just like `<Fragment>`, `<StrictMode>` does not render any extra DOM elements.

Otherwise you will receive the below error in your browser console.\n\n        ```html Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag.```\n\n      2. **All the tags needs to be closed:**\n        Unlike HTML, all tags needs to closed explicitly with in JSX. This rule applies for self-closing tags(like hr, br and img tags) as well.\n      3. **Use camelCase naming:**\n        It is suggested to use camelCase naming for attributes in JSX. For example, the common attributes of HTML elements such as `class`, `tabindex` will be used as `className` and `tabIndex`.  \n        **Note:** There is an exception for aria-* and data-* attributes which should be lower cased all the time."

      {
        "question": "What is the reason behind multiple JSX tags to be wrapped?",
        "answer": "Behind the scenes, JSX is transformed into plain javascript objects. It is not possible to return two or more objects from a function without wrapping into an array.

        "question": "How do you prevent mutating array variables?\n      The preexisting variables outside of the function scope including state, props and context leads to a mutation and they result in unpredictable bugs during the rendering stage. The below points should be taken care while working with arrays variables.",
        "answer": "1. You need to take copy of the original array and perform array operations on it for the rendering purpose. This is called local mutation.\n      2. Avoid triggering mutation methods such as push, pop, sort and reverse methods on original array. It is safe to use filter, map and slice method because they create a new array."

      {
        "question": "What are capture phase events?\n       The `onClickCapture` React event is helpful to catch all the events of child elements irrespective of event propagation logic or even if the events propagation stopped. This is useful if you need to log every click events for analytics purpose.",
        "answer": "For example, the below code triggers the click event of parent first followed by second level child eventhough leaf child button elements stops the propagation.\n\n       ```jsx\n        <div onClickCapture={() => alert('parent')}>\n         <div onClickCapture={() => alert('child')}>\n           <button onClick={e => e.stopPropagation()} />\n           <button onClick={e => e.stopPropagation()} />\n         </div>\n        </div>\n       ```\n       The event propagation for the above code snippet happens in the following order:\n       1. It travels downwards in the DOM tree by calling all `onClickCapture` event handlers.\n       2. It executes `onClick` event handler on the target element.\n       3. It travels upwards in the DOM tree by call all `onClick` event handlers above to it.\n\n  252. ### How does React updates screen in an application?\n\n       React updates UI in three steps,\n       1. **Triggering or initiating a render:** The component is going to triggered for render in two ways.\n\n           1. **Initial render:** When the app starts, you can trigger the initial render by calling `creatRoot` with the target DOM node followed by invoking component's `render` method. For example, the following code snippet renders `App` component on root DOM node.\n            \n            ```jsx\n            import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\n            const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))\n            root.render(<App />);\n            ```\n\n          2. **Re-render when the state updated:** When you update the component state using the state setter function, the componen't state automatically queues for a render.\n\n       2. **Rendering components:** After triggering a render, React will call your components to display them on the screen. React will call the root component for initial render and call the function component whose state update triggered the render. This is a recursive process for all nested components of the target component.\n\n       3. **Commit changes to DOM:** After calling components, React will modify the DOM for initial render using `appendChild()` DOM API and apply minimal necessary DOM updates for re-renders based on differences between rerenders."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does React batch multiple state updates?\n      React prevents component from re-rendering for each and every state update by grouping multiple state updates within an event handler. This strategy improves the application performance and this process known as **batching**. The older version of React only supported batching for browser events whereas React18 supported for asynchronous actions, timeouts and intervals along with native events. This improved version of batching is called **automatic batching**.",
        "answer": "Let's demonstrate this automatic batching feature with a below example.\n\n      ```jsx\n      import { useState } from 'react';\n\n      export default function BatchingState() {\n        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n        const [message, setMessage] = useState('batching');\n\n        console.log('Application Rendered');\n\n        const handleUsers = () => {\n          fetch(\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1\").then(() => {\n              // Automatic Batching re-render only once\n              setCount(count +1);\n              setMessage('users fetched');\n            });\n        }\n\n        return (\n          <>\n            <h1>{count}</h1>\n            <button onClick={handleAsyncFetch}>Click Me!</button>\n          </>\n        )\n      }\n      ```\n\n      The preceeding code updated two state variables with in an event handler. However, React will perform automatic batching feature and the component will be re-rendered only once for better performance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it possible to prevent automatic batching?\n      Yes, it is possible to prevent automatic batching default behavior. There might be cases where you need to re-render your component after each state update or updating one state depends on another state variable. Considering this situation, React introduced `flushSync` method from `react-dom` API for the usecases where you need to flush state updates to DOM immediately.",
        "answer": "The usage of `flushSync` method within an `onClick` event handler will be looking like as below,\n\n      ```jsx\n      import { flushSync } from 'react-dom';\n\n      const handleClick = () => {\n        flushSync(() => {\n          setClicked(!clicked); //Component will create a re-render here\n        });\n        \n        setCount(count + 1); // Component will create a re-render again here\n      };\n      ```\n      In the above click handler, React will update DOM at first using flushSync and second time updates DOM because of the counter setter function by avoiding automatic batching."

        "question": "What is React hydration?\n      React hydration is used to add client-side JavaScript interactivity to pre-rendered static HTML generated by the server. It is used only for server-side rendering(SSR) to enhance the initial rendering time and make it SEO friendly application. This hydration acts as a bridge to reduce the gap between server side and client-side rendering.",
        "answer": "After the page loaded with generated static HTML, React will add application state and interactivity by attaching all event handlers for the respective elements. Let's demonstrate this with an example. \n      \n      Consider that React DOM API(using `renderToString`) generated HTML for `<App>` component which contains `<button>` element to increment the counter.\n\n      ```jsx\n      import {useState} from 'react';\n      import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server';\n\n      export default function App() {\n        const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);\n\n        return (\n          <h1>Counter</h1>\n          <button onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)}>\n            {count} times\n          </button>\n          );\n      }\n\n      const html = renderToString(<App />);\n      ```\n\n      The above code generates the below HTML with a header text and button component without any interactivity.\n\n      ```html\n      <h1>Counter</h1>\n      <button>\n        <!-- -->0<!-- -->\n        times\n      </button>\n      ```\n\n      At this stage `hydrateRoot` API can be used to perform hydration by attaching `onClick` event handler.\n\n      ```jsx\n      import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n      import App from './App.js';\n\n      hydrateRoot(document.getElementById('root'), <App />);\n      ```\n      After this step, you are able to run React application on server-side and hydrating the javascript bundle on client-side for smooth user experience and SEO purposes."

        "question": "How do you update nested objects inside state?\n      You cannot simply use spread syntax for all kinds of objects inside state. Because spread syntax is shallow and it copies properties for one level deep only. If the object has nested object structure, UI doesn't work as expected with regular JavaScript nested property mutation. Let's demonstrate this behavior with an example of User object which has address nested object inside of it.",

In this example, first you need to create copy of address object and update it with the latest value. Later, the adress object should be linked to parent user object something like below.\n\n      ```js\n      setUser({\n        ...user,\n        address: {\n          ...user.address,\n          country: 'Germany'\n        }\n      });\n      ``` \n      This approach is bit verbose and not easy for deep hierarchical state updates.

        "answer": "To ensure that arrays are not mutated, the mutation operations like direct direct assigment(arr[1]='one'), push, pop, shift, unshift, splice etc methods should be avoided on original array. Instead, you can create a copy of existing array with help of array operations such as filter, map, slice, spread syntax etc.\n\n      For example, the below push operation doesn't add the new todo to the total todo's list in an event handler.\n\n      ```jsx\n      onClick = {\n        todos.push({\n          id: id+1,\n          name: name\n        })\n      }\n      ```\n      This issue is fixed by replacing push operation with spread syntax where it will create a new array and the UI updated with new todo.\n\n      ```jsx\n      onClick = {\n        [\n          ...todos,\n          { id: id+1, name: name }\n        ]\n      }\n      ```"

        "question": "How do you use immer library for state updates?\n      Immer library enforces the immutability of state based on **copy-on-write** mechanism. It uses JavaScript proxy to keep track of updates to immutable states. Immer has 3 main states as below,",
        "answer": "1. **Current state:** It refers to actual state\n      2. **Draft state:** All new changes will be applied to this state. In this state, draft is just a proxy of the current state.\n      3. **Next state:** It is formed after all mutations applied to the draft state\n\n      Immer can be used by following below instructions,\n\n      1. Install the dependency using `npm install use-immer` command\n      2. Replace `useState` hook with `useImmer` hook by importing at the top\n      3. The setter function of `useImmer` hook can be used to update the state.\n\n      For example, the mutation syntax of immer library simplies the nested address object of user state as follows,\n\n      ```jsx\n      import { useImmer } from 'use-immer';\n      const [user, setUser]= useImmer({\n          name: 'John',\n          age: 32,\n            address: {\n          country: 'Singapore',\n          postalCode: 440004\n            }\n      });\n\n      //Update user details upon any event\n      setUser(draft => {\n        draft.address.country = 'Germany';\n      });\n      ```\n      The preceeding code enables you to update nested objects with a conceise mutation syntax."

These reducers run during rendering time similar to state updater functions. So these functions should not send any requests, schedule time outs and any other side effects.\n\n     2. Each action should describe a single user interaction eventhough there are multiple changes applied to data. For example, if you \"reset\" registration form which has many user input fields managed by a reducer, it is suggested to send one \"reset\" action instead of creating separate action for each fields. The proper ordering of actions should reflect the user interactions in the browser and it helps a lot for debugging purpose."

        "question": "How to bind methods or event handlers in JSX callbacks?",
        "answer": "There are 3 possible ways to achieve this in class components:\n\n    1. **Binding in Constructor:** In JavaScript classes, the methods are not bound by default. The same rule applies for React event handlers defined as class methods. Normally we bind them in constructor.\n\n       ```javascript\n       class User extends Component {\n         constructor(props) {\n           super(props);\n           this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);\n         }\n         handleClick() {\n           console.log(\"SingOut triggered\");\n         }\n         render() {\n           return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>SingOut</button>;\n         }\n       }\n       ```\n\n    2. **Public class fields syntax:** If you don't like to use bind approach then _public class fields syntax_ can be used to correctly bind callbacks. The Create React App enables this syntax by default.\n\n       ```jsx harmony\n       handleClick = () => {\n         console.log(\"SingOut triggered\", this);\n       };\n       ```\n\n       ```jsx harmony\n       <button onClick={this.handleClick}>SingOut</button>\n       ```\n\n    3. **Arrow functions in callbacks:** It is possible to use _arrow functions_ directly in the callbacks.\n\n       ```jsx harmony\n       handleClick() {\n           console.log('SingOut triggered');\n       }\n       render() {\n           return <button onClick={() => this.handleClick()}>SignOut</button>;\n       }\n       ```\n\n    **Note:** If the callback is passed as prop to child components, those components might do an extra re-rendering. In those cases, it is preferred to go with `.bind()` or _public class fields syntax_ approach considering performance."

      {
        "question": "How to pass a parameter to an event handler or callback?",

        "question": "How to create refs?",
        "answer": "There are two approaches\n\n    1. This is a recently added approach. _Refs_ are created using `React.createRef()` method and attached to React elements via the `ref` attribute. In order to use _refs_ throughout the component, just assign the _ref_ to the instance property within constructor.\n\n       ```jsx harmony\n       class MyComponent extends React.Component {\n         constructor(props) {\n           super(props);\n           this.myRef = React.createRef();\n         }\n         render() {\n           return <div ref={this.myRef} />;\n         }\n       }\n       ```\n\n    2. You can also use ref callbacks approach regardless of React version. For example, the search bar component's input element is accessed as follows,\n       ```jsx harmony\n       class SearchBar extends Component {\n         constructor(props) {\n           super(props);\n           this.txtSearch = null;\n           this.state = { term: \"\" };\n           this.setInputSearchRef = (e) => {\n             this.txtSearch = e;\n           };\n         }\n         onInputChange(event) {\n           this.setState({ term: this.txtSearch.value });\n         }\n         render() {\n           return (\n             <input\n               value={this.state.term}\n               onChange={this.onInputChange.bind(this)}\n               ref={this.setInputSearchRef}\n             />\n           );\n         }\n       }\n       ```\n\n    You can also use _refs_ in function components using **closures**.\n    **Note**: You can also use inline ref callbacks even though it is not a recommended approach."

      {
        "question": "Why are String Refs legacy?",
        "answer": "If you worked with React before, you might be familiar with an older API where the `ref` attribute is a string, like `ref={'textInput'}`, and the DOM node is accessed as `this.refs.textInput`. We advise against it because _string refs have below issues_, and are considered legacy. String refs were **removed in React v16**.\n\n    1. They _force React to keep track of currently executing component_. This is problematic because it makes react module stateful, and thus causes weird errors when react module is duplicated in the bundle.\n    2. They are _not composable_ — if a library puts a ref on the passed child, the user can't put another ref on it. Callback refs are perfectly composable.\n    3. They _don't work with static analysis_ like Flow. Flow can't guess the magic that framework does to make the string ref appear on `this.refs`, as well as its type (which could be different). Callback refs are friendlier to static analysis.\n    4. It doesn't work as most people would expect with the \"render callback\" pattern (e.g. <DataGrid renderRow={this.renderRow} />)\n\n       ```jsx harmony\n       class MyComponent extends Component {\n         renderRow = (index) => {\n           // This won't work. Ref will get attached to DataTable rather than MyComponent:\n           return <input ref={\"input-\" + index} />;\n\n           // This would work though! Callback refs are awesome.\n           return <input ref={(input) => (this[\"input-\" + index] = input)} />;\n         };\n\n         render() {\n           return (\n             <DataTable data={this.props.data} renderRow={this.renderRow} />\n           );\n         }\n       }\n       ```"

        "answer": "The component lifecycle has three distinct lifecycle phases:\n\n    1. **Mounting:** The component is ready to mount in the browser DOM. This phase covers initialization from `constructor()`, `getDerivedStateFromProps()`, `render()`, and `componentDidMount()` lifecycle methods.\n\n    2. **Updating:** In this phase, the component gets updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state either from `setState()` or `forceUpdate()`. This phase covers `getDerivedStateFromProps()`, `shouldComponentUpdate()`, `render()`, `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` and `componentDidUpdate()` lifecycle methods.\n\n    3. **Unmounting:** In this last phase, the component is not needed and gets unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes `componentWillUnmount()` lifecycle method.\n\n    It's worth mentioning that React internally has a concept of phases when applying changes to the DOM. They are separated as follows\n\n    1. **Render** The component will render without any side effects. This applies to Pure components and in this phase, React can pause, abort, or restart the render.\n\n    2. **Pre-commit** Before the component actually applies the changes to the DOM, there is a moment that allows React to read from the DOM through the `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`.\n\n    3. **Commit** React works with the DOM and executes the final lifecycles respectively `componentDidMount()` for mounting, `componentDidUpdate()` for updating, and `componentWillUnmount()` for unmounting.\n\n    React 16.3+ Phases (or an [interactive version](http://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/))\n\n    ![phases 16.4+](images/phases16.4.png)\n\n    Before React 16.3\n\n    ![phases 16.2](images/phases.png)"

      },
      {
        "question": "Why we need to pass a function to setState()?",
        "answer": "The reason behind for this is that `setState()` is an asynchronous operation. React batches state changes for performance reasons, so the state may not change immediately after `setState()` is called. That means you should not rely on the current state when calling `setState()` since you can't be sure what that state will be. The solution is to pass a function to `setState()`, with the previous state as an argument. By doing this you can avoid issues with the user getting the old state value on access due to the asynchronous nature of `setState()`.\n\n    Let's say the initial count value is zero. After three consecutive increment operations, the value is going to be incremented only by one.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // assuming this.state.count === 0\n    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });\n    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });\n    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });\n    // this.state.count === 1, not 3\n    ```\n\n    If we pass a function to `setState()`, the count gets incremented correctly.\n\n    ```javascript\n    this.setState((prevState, props) => ({\n      count: prevState.count + props.increment,\n    }));\n    // this.state.count === 3 as expected\n    ```\n\n    **(OR)**\n\n    ### Why function is preferred over object for `setState()`?\n\n    React may batch multiple `setState()` calls into a single update for performance. Because `this.props` and `this.state` may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.\n\n    This counter example will fail to update as expected:\n\n    ```javascript\n    // Wrong\n    this.setState({\n      counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,\n    });\n    ```\n\n    The preferred approach is to call `setState()` with function rather than object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // Correct\n    this.setState((prevState, props) => ({\n      counter: prevState.counter + props.increment,\n    }));\n    ```"
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is `isMounted()` an anti-pattern and what is the proper solution?",
        "answer": "The primary use case for `isMounted()` is to avoid calling `setState()` after a component has been unmounted, because it will emit a warning.\n\n    ```javascript\n    if (this.isMounted()) {\n      this.setState({...})\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Checking `isMounted()` before calling `setState()` does eliminate the warning, but it also defeats the purpose of the warning. Using `isMounted()` is a code smell because the only reason you would check is because you think you might be holding a reference after the component has unmounted.\n\n    An optimal solution would be to find places where `setState()` might be called after a component has unmounted, and fix them. Such situations most commonly occur due to callbacks, when a component is waiting for some data and gets unmounted before the data arrives. Ideally, any callbacks should be canceled in `componentWillUnmount()`, prior to unmounting."

        "answer": "If the ref callback is defined as an inline function, it will get called twice during updates, first with null and then again with the DOM element. This is because a new instance of the function is created with each render, so React needs to clear the old ref and set up the new one.\n\n     ```jsx\n     class UserForm extends Component {\n       handleSubmit = () => {\n         console.log(\"Input Value is: \", this.input.value);\n       };\n\n       render() {\n         return (\n           <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>\n             <input type=\"text\" ref={(input) => (this.input = input)} /> //\n             Access DOM input in handle submit\n             <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n           </form>\n         );\n       }\n     }\n     ```\n\n     But our expectation is for the ref callback to get called once, when the component mounts. One quick fix is to use the ES7 class property syntax to define the function\n\n     ```jsx\n     class UserForm extends Component {\n       handleSubmit = () => {\n         console.log(\"Input Value is: \", this.input.value);\n       };\n\n       setSearchInput = (input) => {\n         this.input = input;\n       };\n\n       render() {\n         return (\n           <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>\n             <input type=\"text\" ref={this.setSearchInput} /> // Access DOM input\n             in handle submit\n             <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n           </form>\n         );\n       }\n     }\n     ```"

Inheritance Inversion (II).\n\n     But they follow different approaches for manipulating the _WrappedComponent_.\n\n     **Props Proxy**\n\n     In this approach, the render method of the HOC returns a React Element of the type of the WrappedComponent. We also pass through the props that the HOC receives, hence the name **Props Proxy**.\n\n     ```jsx\n     function ppHOC(WrappedComponent) {\n       return class PP extends React.Component {\n         render() {\n           return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;\n         }\n       };\n     }\n     ```\n\n     **Inheritance Inversion**\n\n     In this approach, the returned HOC class (Enhancer) extends the WrappedComponent.

Below are the few listed in an order,\n\n     1. **Don’t use HOCs inside the render method:**\n        It is not recommended to apply a HOC to a component within the render method of a component.\n\n        ```javascript\n        render() {\n          // A new version of EnhancedComponent is created on every render\n          // EnhancedComponent1 !== EnhancedComponent2\n          const EnhancedComponent = enhance(MyComponent);\n          // That causes the entire subtree to unmount/remount each time!\n          return <EnhancedComponent />;\n        }\n        ```\n\n        The above code impacts on performance by remounting a component that causes the state of that component and all of its children to be lost. Instead, apply HOCs outside the component definition so that the resulting component is created only once.\n\n     2. **Static methods must be copied over:**\n        When you apply a HOC to a component the new component does not have any of the static methods of the original component\n\n        ```javascript\n        // Define a static method\n        WrappedComponent.staticMethod = function () {\n          /*...*/\n        };\n        // Now apply a HOC\n        const EnhancedComponent = enhance(WrappedComponent);\n\n        // The enhanced component has no static method\n        typeof EnhancedComponent.staticMethod === \"undefined\"; // true\n        ```\n\n        You can overcome this by copying the methods onto the container before returning it,\n\n        ```javascript\n        function enhance(WrappedComponent) {\n          class Enhance extends React.Component {\n            /*...*/\n          }\n          // Must know exactly which method(s) to copy :(\n          Enhance.staticMethod = WrappedComponent.staticMethod;\n          return Enhance;\n        }\n        ```\n\n     3. **Refs aren’t passed through:**\n        For HOCs you need to pass through all props to the wrapped component but this does not work for refs. This is because ref is not really a prop similar to key. In this case you need to use the React.forwardRef API"

This can be achieved through arrow functions or bind method.\n\n     Let us take an example of user details updated in a grid,\n\n     ```javascript\n     <button onClick={(e) => this.updateUser(userId, e)}>Update User details</button>\n     <button onClick={this.updateUser.bind(this, userId)}>Update User details</button>\n     ```\n\n     In the both approaches, the synthetic argument `e` is passed as a second argument. You need to pass it explicitly for arrow functions and it will be passed automatically for `bind` method."

        "answer": "You can prevent component from rendering by returning null based on specific condition. This way it can conditionally render component.\n\n     ```javascript\n     function Greeting(props) {\n       if (!props.loggedIn) {\n         return null;\n       }\n\n       return <div className=\"greeting\">welcome, {props.name}</div>;\n     }\n     ```\n\n     ```javascript\n     class User extends React.Component {\n       constructor(props) {\n         super(props);\n         this.state = {loggedIn: false, name: 'John'};\n       }\n\n       render() {\n        return (\n            <div>\n              //Prevent component render if it is not loggedIn\n              <Greeting loggedIn={this.state.loggedIn} />\n              <UserDetails name={this.state.name}>\n            </div>\n        );\n       }\n     ```\n\n     In the above example, the `greeting` component skips its rendering section by applying condition and returning null value."

        "question": "How do you use contextType?",
        "answer": "ContextType is used to consume the context object. The contextType property can be used in two ways,\n\n     1. **contextType as property of class:**\n        The contextType property on a class can be assigned a Context object created by React.createContext(). After that, you can consume the nearest current value of that Context type using this.context in any of the lifecycle methods and render function.\n\n        Lets assign contextType property on MyClass as below,\n\n        ```javascript\n        class MyClass extends React.Component {\n          componentDidMount() {\n            let value = this.context;\n            /* perform a side-effect at mount using the value of MyContext */\n          }\n          componentDidUpdate() {\n            let value = this.context;\n            /* ... */\n          }\n          componentWillUnmount() {\n            let value = this.context;\n            /* ... */\n          }\n          render() {\n            let value = this.context;\n            /* render something based on the value of MyContext */\n          }\n        }\n        MyClass.contextType = MyContext;\n        ```\n\n     2. **Static field**\n        You can use a static class field to initialize your contextType using public class field syntax.\n\n        ```javascript\n        class MyClass extends React.Component {\n          static contextType = MyContext;\n          render() {\n            let value = this.context;\n            /* render something based on the value */\n          }\n        }\n        ```"
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a consumer?",
        "answer": "A Consumer is a React component that subscribes to context changes. It requires a function as a child which receives current context value as argument and returns a react node. The value argument passed to the function will be equal to the value prop of the closest Provider for this context above in the tree.\n\n     Lets take a simple example,\n\n     ```javascript\n     <MyContext.Consumer>\n       {value => /* render something based on the context value */}\n     </MyContext.Consumer>\n     ```"

        "question": "How do you solve performance corner cases while using context?",
        "answer": "The context uses reference identity to determine when to re-render, there are some gotchas that could trigger unintentional renders in consumers when a provider’s parent re-renders.\n\n     For example, the code below will re-render all consumers every time the Provider re-renders because a new object is always created for value.\n\n     ```javascript\n     class App extends React.Component {\n       render() {\n         return (\n           <Provider value={{ something: \"something\" }}>\n             <Toolbar />\n           </Provider>\n         );\n       }\n     }\n     ```\n\n     This can be solved by lifting up the value to parent state,\n\n     ```javascript\n     class App extends React.Component {\n       constructor(props) {\n         super(props);\n         this.state = {\n           value: { something: \"something\" },\n         };\n       }\n\n       render() {\n         return (\n           <Provider value={this.state.value}>\n             <Toolbar />\n           </Provider>\n         );\n       }\n     }\n     ```"

        "question": "What is the purpose of forward ref in HOCs?",
        "answer": "Refs will not get passed through because ref is not a prop. It is handled differently by React just like **key**. If you add a ref to a HOC, the ref will refer to the outermost container component, not the wrapped component. In this case, you can use Forward Ref API. For example, we can explicitly forward refs to the inner FancyButton component using the React.forwardRef API.\n\n     The below HOC logs all props,\n\n     ```javascript\n     function logProps(Component) {\n       class LogProps extends React.Component {\n         componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {\n           console.log(\"old props:\", prevProps);\n           console.log(\"new props:\", this.props);\n         }\n\n         render() {\n           const { forwardedRef, ...rest } = this.props;\n\n           // Assign the custom prop \"forwardedRef\" as a ref\n           return <Component ref={forwardedRef} {...rest} />;\n         }\n       }\n\n       return React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {\n         return <LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} />;\n       });\n     }\n     ```\n\n     Let's use this HOC to log all props that get passed to our “fancy button” component,\n\n     ```javascript\n     class FancyButton extends React.Component {\n       focus() {\n         // ...\n       }\n\n       // ...\n     }\n     export default logProps(FancyButton);\n     ```\n\n     Now let's create a ref and pass it to FancyButton component. In this case, you can set focus to button element.\n\n     ```javascript\n     import FancyButton from \"./FancyButton\";\n\n     const ref = React.createRef();\n     ref.current.focus();\n     <FancyButton label=\"Click Me\" handleClick={handleClick} ref={ref} />;\n     ```"

      {
        "question": "Is ref argument available for all functions or class components?\n     Regular function or class components don’t receive the ref argument, and ref is not available in props either. The second ref argument only exists when you define a component with React.forwardRef call.",
        "answer": "**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n81. ### Why do you need additional care for component libraries while using forward refs?\n     When you start using forwardRef in a component library, you should treat it as a breaking change and release a new major version of your library. This is because your library likely has a different behavior such as what refs get assigned to, and what types are exported. These changes can break apps and other libraries that depend on the old behavior."

        "question": "How to create react class components without ES6?",
        "answer": "If you don’t use ES6 then you may need to use the create-react-class module instead. For default props, you need to define getDefaultProps() as a function on the passed object. Whereas for initial state, you have to provide a separate getInitialState method that returns the initial state.\n\n     ```javascript\n     var Greeting = createReactClass({\n       getDefaultProps: function () {\n         return {\n           name: \"Jhohn\",\n         };\n       },\n       getInitialState: function () {\n         return { message: this.props.message };\n       },\n       handleClick: function () {\n         console.log(this.state.message);\n       },\n       render: function () {\n         return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;\n       },\n     });\n     ```\n\n     **Note:** If you use createReactClass then auto binding is available for all methods. i.e, You don't need to use `.bind(this)` with in constructor for event handlers."

        "answer": "Yes, JSX is not mandatory for using React. Actually it is convenient when you don’t want to set up compilation in your build environment. Each JSX element is just syntactic sugar for calling `React.createElement(component, props, ...children)`.\n\n     For example, let us take a greeting example with JSX,\n\n     ```javascript\n     class Greeting extends React.Component {\n       render() {\n         return <div>Hello {this.props.message}</div>;\n       }\n     }\n\n     ReactDOM.render(\n       <Greeting message=\"World\" />,\n       document.getElementById(\"root\")\n     );\n     ```\n\n     You can write the same code without JSX as below,\n\n     ```javascript\n     class Greeting extends React.Component {\n       render() {\n         return React.createElement(\"div\", null, `Hello ${this.props.message}`);\n       }\n     }\n\n     ReactDOM.render(\n       React.createElement(Greeting, { message: \"World\" }, null),\n       document.getElementById(\"root\")\n     );\n     ```"

        "question": "How do you create HOC using render props?",
        "answer": "You can implement most higher-order components (HOC) using a regular component with a render prop. For example, if you would prefer to have a withMouse HOC instead of a <Mouse> component, you could easily create one using a regular <Mouse> with a render prop.\n\n     ```javascript\n     function withMouse(Component) {\n       return class extends React.Component {\n         render() {\n           return (\n             <Mouse\n               render={(mouse) => <Component {...this.props} mouse={mouse} />}\n             />\n           );\n         }\n       };\n     }\n     ```\n\n     This way render props gives the flexibility of using either pattern."

        "question": "What is state mutation and how to prevent it?",
        "answer": "`State mutation` happens when you try to update the state of a component without actually using `setState` function. This can happen when you are trying to do some computations using a state variable and unknowingly save the result in the same state variable. This is the main reason why it is advised to return new instances of state variables from the reducers by using Object.assign({}, ...) or spread syntax.\n\n     This can cause unknown issues in the UI as the value of the state variable got updated without telling React to check what all components were being affected from this update and it can cause UI bugs.\n\n     Ex:\n\n     ```javascript\n     class A extends React.component {\n       constructor(props) {\n         super(props);\n         this.state = {\n           loading: false\n         }\n      }\n\n     componentDidMount() {\n       let { loading } = this.state;\n       loading = (() => true)(); // Trying to perform an operation and directly saving in a state variable\n     }\n\n     ```\n\n     **How to prevent it:** Make sure your state variables are immutable by either enforcing immutability by using plugins like Immutable.js, always using `setState` to make updates, and returning new instances in reducers when sending updated state values."
